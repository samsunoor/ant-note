# ant-note

Developed for learning purpose in effort to understand MVP pattern and kotlin implementation on Android and its libraries.

Libraries :
- Room Android Architecture Component
- Rx

### To do :
- [x] Show note list
- [ ] Insert note
- [ ] Update note
- [ ] Delete note
- [ ] Firebase for storing data remotely
- [ ] Client side data encryption with asymetric key
- [ ] Store private key to remote (using archive and password)
- [ ] Store private key offline as an image

By the way, I haven't found any library to archive the private key with password.
Maybe I will change the mechanism to combine AES and RSA algorithm

### Make it optional for :
- [ ] Remote storage
- [ ] Encryption storage
- [ ] Private key storage
